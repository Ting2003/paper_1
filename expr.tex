\section{Experiments}
We performed the proposed method in C++. Six industrial benchmarks from \cite{IBM} are used to test its performance. The
program is run on a shared memory system with 64G RAM and 32 threads. The CPU frequency of the system is 1.33GHz. 

% 1. build path: show time for building, and saving brought with build path
%In the experiment result, need a table to show the ratio saved with this technique, and the speed for building the paths% 

% 2. Reordering technique:
%In Experiment result, need a table to show the time savings with the reordering technique% 

% 3. Supernode solving:
%In experiment result, need a table to show the time savings with Memorized supernode solving technique%

% 4. Total results: including single thread, and multiple threads
%List the tables for experimental results, including one of the slow cpu time, fast CPU
