\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we propose a parallel method for power grid transient analysis. Trapezoidal models of capacitance and inductance are 
utilized to make a SPD conductance matrix. Techniques such as sparse vector, position mapping, memory supernode, optimized current 
re-stamping are developed to accelerate forward and backward substitution process. Multiple threads are utilized to parallelize the
simulation process. Six industrial benchmarks are used to test the performance of the solver. This solver won the first prize of the
11 teams registered in TAU contest.
